Step 1 --> create a workspace and Installation of python package in vs code or cmd

Step 2  -->  Installation of necessary extensions in vs code as it suggests automatically install tesseract package from git as well as multilang package from git

Step 3--> Create a file name sample.py and type the necessary code

from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import os

# Set the path to the Tesseract executable
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

# Set the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable
os.environ['TESSDATA_PREFIX'] = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tessdatanew\tessdatamain'

# Open the image using Pillow (PIL Fork)
image_path = r'C:\Users\Methuna\Desktop\python\hindi_image.jpg'
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Use pytesseract to extract Hindi text from the image
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='hin')

# Print the extracted text
print(text)

Step 4---> create a another file named image.png or according to the image type

Step 5--> To run the code , in the terminal type "python sample.py" as sample.py is the file name
